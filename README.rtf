In this exercise, I am getting the data from an API to write it in a csv file.
I am combining APIs to consolidate the daily data to obtain the weekly data.
API data has a many nested dictionaries in a JSON format.

Next actions to improve;

    1- Make the number of days as an input
    2- Make the region as an input ( Y/N to specify is needed)
    3- Plotting number of cases by region
    4- Prediction of number of cases for region
